# Evolve fitness, story of a fresh start

## Sarah is one of our clients who wants a fresh start. She needs a robust MySQL database system, and we are the data guru she hired to build it!

## Steps we took in building the database of her dream is highlighted below:

- Started from scratch by highlighting the existing pen and paper documentation / inventory
- We gathered all the necessary data, colloacted and cleaned it
- The data where imported via MYSQL benchmark
- Had a meeting with Sarah to ensure that we are on same page with her dream database, she was happy with the design concept and logical ERD we gave her.
