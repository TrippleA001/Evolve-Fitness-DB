Data for membership tiers was included in the project brief:
Tier Details (as of May 27, 2025):
Tier 1: "Bronze" - $30.00/month - "Access to gym floor during all hours, 2 group class credits/month."
Tier 2: "Silver" - $50.00/month - "Full gym floor access, 10 group class credits/month, towel service."
Tier 3: "Gold" - $80.00/month - "Full gym floor access, unlimited group classes, personal trainer discount (10%), sauna access."
Tier 4: "Platinum" - $120.00/month - "All Gold benefits, +2 free personal training sessions/month, nutritional guidance session quarterly."



You're off to a strong start with the six tables, and your goals are clear: **operational efficiency**, **business insights**, and **member experience**. I'll help you:

1. **Refine the schema**
2. **Ensure relationships are optimized**
3. **Suggest fields and indexes**
4. **Provide SQL report queries**

```

---

### 2. **Most Popular Classes This Month**

```sql
SELECT c.name, COUNT(b.booking_id) AS bookings
FROM bookings b

LIMIT 5;
```

---

### 3. **Total Revenue This Month (by Tier and Overall)**

```sql
-- Total revenue
SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_revenue
FROM payments
WHERE MONTH(payment_date) = MONTH(CURRENT_DATE())
  AND YEAR(payment_date) = YEAR(CURRENT_DATE());

-- Revenue by tier
SELECT mt.name, SUM(p.amount) AS tier_revenue
FROM payments p
JOIN membership_tier mt ON p.tier_id = mt.tier_id
WHERE MONTH(p.payment_date) = MONTH(CURRENT_DATE())
  AND YEAR(p.payment_date) = YEAR(CURRENT_DATE())

FROM classes c
JOIN instructors i ON c.instructor_id = i.instructor_id
WHERE YEARWEEK(c.schedule_datetime, 1) = YEARWEEK(CURRENT_DATE(), 1)
GROUP BY i.instructor_id;
```

---

## üîê Considerations

* Indexes on `member_id`, `class_id`, `schedule_datetime`, `membership_end`, and `payment_date`.
* Foreign key constraints for integrity.
* Optionally add audit tables for logging changes.

---

Would you like a **schema diagram** or **SQL DDL scripts** to get started with the actual database creation?



You're approaching this like a professional, and with a bit of refinement, your database can absolutely support the **operational** and **analytical** needs of a gym. Let's approach this like a seasoned **Database Administrator (DBA)** and audit your schema critically from multiple perspectives:

---

## üîç CRITICAL REVIEW OF EXISTING TABLES

### ‚úÖ 1. `membership_tier`

**Strengths:**

* Captures price and duration.
* Serves as a clean dimension table.

**Suggestions:**

* Add a `recurring` flag (`BOOLEAN`) for future-proofing (e.g., auto-renewal).
* Consider `max_classes_per_month` to enforce usage rules for tiers.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. `members`

**Strengths:**

* Has tier linkage and status tracking.

**Issues / Improvements:**

* **Missing Address Info** ‚Äì Add `address`, `dob`, or `emergency_contact`.
* **Missing Login/Auth** ‚Äì If there's a member portal, you need `username`, `password_hash`, `created_at`.
* Membership history tracking is **absent**. This is a big miss. A separate `membership_history` table is more normalized.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. `instructors`

**Strengths:**

* Captures basic details.

**Suggestions:**

* Add `availability_schedule` (or model this separately) ‚Äì this is key for class planning.
* Track certifications or employment status (`active/inactive`), in case of temporary instructors.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. `classes`

**Strengths:**

* Captures capacity, schedule, and instructor.

**Improvements:**

* You're mixing **class type** and **individual session**.

  * A Yoga class offered every Monday is a *class type*.
  * The session on *Monday June 3rd, 6pm* is a *class instance*.
* Split into:

  * `class_types` (Yoga, Pilates, etc.)
  * `class_sessions` (specific date/time slots)
* Consider fields like `location` (room/gym area), `status` (cancelled/active), or `is_recurring`.

---

### ‚úÖ 5. `bookings`

**Strengths:**

* Tracks who booked what class.

**Suggestions:**

* Add `booking_status` (`booked`, `attended`, `no-show`, `cancelled`) for analytics and automation (like penalties).
* Add timestamps: `created_at`, `cancelled_at`.

---

### ‚úÖ 6. `payments`

**Strengths:**

* Captures amount and tier info.

**Critical Misses:**

* Doesn‚Äôt support multiple products: what if they pay for PT sessions, merchandise, or one-off classes?
* You need a `products` table and link it via a `payment_items` junction table.

---

## üö® MISSING TABLES (Gaps That Need Closing)

### ‚ùó 7. `membership_history`

* Purpose: Tracks all past membership changes for auditing and renewals.

```sql
| history_id | member_id | tier_id | start_date | end_date | status |
```

---

### ‚ùó 8. `class_types` and `class_sessions`

* Normalizes repeated sessions.

```sql
-- class_types
| class_type_id | name | description | default_duration | default_capacity |

-- class_sessions
| session_id | class_type_id | instructor_id | datetime | capacity |
```

---

### ‚ùó 9. `attendance`

* Actual class attendance (vs just bookings).

```sql
| attendance_id | session_id | member_id | status (attended/no-show) |
```

---

### ‚ùó 10. `products`

* All billable items: membership, merchandise, PT sessions.

```sql
| product_id | name | type (membership, retail, PT) | price |
```

---

### ‚ùó 11. `payment_items`

* Supports itemized invoices per payment.

```sql
| payment_id | product_id | quantity | amount |
```

---

### ‚ùó 12. `staff` or `users`

* Needed for admin access and management.

```sql
| user_id | username | password_hash | role (admin/trainer/receptionist) |
```

---

### ‚ùó 13. `locations` or `rooms`

* For large gyms with multiple studios or branches.

---

## ‚úÖ BEST PRACTICES TO FOLLOW

| Area               | Recommendation                                                                                           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Integrity** | Use `FOREIGN KEYS`, `CHECK` constraints, and standard ENUM values.                                       |
| **Scalability**    | Normalize class sessions and payments for future-proofing.                                               |
| **Security**       | Store hashed passwords, track user roles.                                                                |
| **Analytics**      | Add timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`) to all core tables.                                          |
| **Automation**     | Consider using triggers or scheduled procedures to update status fields (e.g., auto-expire memberships). |
| **Indexes**        | Index on `booking_date`, `member_id`, `class_id`, `payment_date`, `status`.                              |

---

## üß© CONCLUSION

You‚Äôre **70‚Äì80% there** structurally, but to make this a **robust, enterprise-grade system**, you should:

* **Normalize classes and payments** more granularly
* **Track histories** and **statuses** better
* **Add supporting tables** like `products`, `attendance`, and `membership_history`
* **Future-proof** for features like e-commerce, reporting, and mobile check-ins

Would you like a **fully normalized ERD diagram** or the **SQL DDL scripts** for this upgraded schema?
